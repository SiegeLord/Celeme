Short term things:

- Vectorize reads/writes for the benefit of AMD GPU's

- Write a serial path for syn_thresholds for the benefit of CPU's

- Maybe write an integrator with step rejection (shouldn't be a lot of work)

- Test on Windows now that I have a OpenCL GPU on Windows

- It should be possible to set the workgroup sizes on a per-neuron group basis

- Figure out exactly why performance is not so hot (or maybe it is hot, but I don't really understand it)

- Think about caching kernels (might not be needed for Python port, as it has interactive coding)

- Test on NVidia hardware

Long term things:

- Multiple compartments per cell

- Figure out a solution for needless simulation of spike traces (e.g. add a mechanism to pause a neuron or something)
